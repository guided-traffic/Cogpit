import "context"

// A private connection of the built-in agent (D-10, H-94; the owner's decision of 2026-10-14 late
// evening). The user marks an LLM connection "private (a local model or a private cloud)"; the
// agent then dispatches its tool calls with Invocation.ReadsLikeUser, and the engine gives such a
// turn what the window shows instead of what agents are given: Secret values (object.get, an
// editor's text, a logs tab's lines unscrubbed), Helm's user-supplied values, Flux's credential
// fields, a failed Helm action's error, the window's notifications in full. Dispatch honours the
// mark only with OriginBuiltInAgent and carries it in the command's context (ReadsLikeUser); every
// read path that withholds from agents asks ReadsLikeUser or ReadsAsAgent instead of the origin
// alone. Write rules never ask it: D-2's confirmations, the agents-ask rules (H-27, A1, A2), the
// GUI-only commands (secret.reveal, secret.create, ...), a Secret's Edit and Create tabs (D-19),
// the markers an agent may not write back, and a terminal tab's agent-read switch (H-83) are the
// same for a private turn as for any agent. The audit log marks the private turn's lines
// (AuditEntry.ReadsLikeUser) and keeps values out of them as for every origin.

// readsLikeUserKey is the context key under which Dispatch hands a command whether its reads are
// a private turn's.
