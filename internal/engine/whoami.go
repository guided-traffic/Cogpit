// Who Cogpit is logged in as (D-68, the owner, 2026-10-16). At every connect to a real cluster the
// connection asks the API server who it is (cluster.Conn.ReviewUser: one SelfSubjectReview, what
// `kubectl auth whoami` asks), and asks again whenever the connection comes back from an
// interruption or a renewed login (connwatch.go's reconnect). The navigator's root row shows the
// username, its groups behind a box's tooltip; agents read the same in ui_state's user. When the
// API server does not know the review (older than 1.27) or refuses it, the kubeconfig's user entry's
// name stands in, marked as such; while the cluster is not connected, the last username the API
// server confirmed for the context, with when it was last seen (whoami_store.go). A review that
// fails never fails the connect.
