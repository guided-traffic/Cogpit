// Reconcile with Source waits as the flux CLI does (A91, the owner's decision of 2026-10-14
// evening; D-33): `flux reconcile kustomization|helmrelease --with-source` asks the source's
// controller to reconcile it, waits until the controller has handled the request and the source
// is ready (at most --timeout, 5 minutes by default), and only then asks for the object, and waits
// for it too. Cogpit runs that as a background job (engine/jobs.go) with a dock tab of its own: the
// command checks everything, as before, and returns the job's tab at once; the job writes each
// reconcile request in its chain's order, the deepest source first, and waits for each through the
// cache (Session.WaitFluxReconciled, no polling), at most fluxJobWait per object. A source that
// ends not ready, times out or fails stops what depends on it: its object is not asked to reconcile,
// as the flux CLI stops. On a selection the objects' chains run side by side, a source two objects
// share is asked once, and one that fails fails only the objects that need it.
//
// Its steps (one per object written, the sources first) and its outcome are the tab's engine state,
// which agents read with ui_state; a toast says how it ended. Closing the tab stops the job; what
// it wrote stays. A crash ends it as well and leaves at most sources asked to reconcile whose
// objects were not asked yet: harmless, since the source's controller only fetches the source
// again, and kustomize-controller and helm-controller reconcile the object at their next interval
// or when the source's artifact changes (Flux's documentation), as if nobody had asked. So the job
// keeps no journal (D-11).

// fluxJobWait bounds the wait for each object's controller: the flux CLI's --timeout default.
