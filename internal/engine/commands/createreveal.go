// After a create in the window, the new object is shown (A102, owner 2026-10-14 evening): its

// as ui.navigate shows an object. The lead's night decisions for the owner to confirm: only the
// user's own create moves the window (an agent's create leaves the window where the user has it),
// and only a create of exactly one object (several: the toast names them; which one to show is no
// clear choice).

// revealCreated navigates to the object a create made, under the rules above. A navigation that
// fails leaves the create's result as it is.
