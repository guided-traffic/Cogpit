// node.drain as a background job (D-63, built 2026-10-16): after its confirmation (destructive,
// for every origin) the command records the drain in the journal, starts a job and returns at once
// with the job's dock tab. The job's steps are the cordon, then one per pod the drain evicts: the
// cache's pods on the node while the drain has not listed them (when the cache holds the cluster's
// pods: the Nodes view reads them), the drain's own list once it has. A pod's step runs while its
// eviction is asked for ("Evicting"), refused for now ("Waiting: the PodDisruptionBudget web allows
// no disruption now (…); retrying") and accepted ("Evicted; waiting for the pod to end"), and ends
// done ("Evicted", "Gone already"), failed with the API server's error, or stopped. The job's
// outcome counts the pods evicted, failed and not attempted.
//
// The job keeps the command's context values but not its cancellation (JobSpec.Parent): an MCP
// client that gives up on its call, or the call's end, no longer cancels the drain the user
// confirmed. job.cancel, closing the tab, another cluster, an interrupted connection (D-58) and
// Cogpit closing stop it: the drain's context ends, the library stops at its next request or wait,
// and the journal keeps the drain as stopped with the cause. Nothing is undone and the node is not
// uncordoned: the banner offers Finish drain, Uncordon and Dismiss, as after a crash (D-11, S8).
// The journal is as crash-safe as before: written before the cordon, removed when every pod is
// gone, kept failed or stopped otherwise.
