// job.cancel (G4, 2026-10-16): stops a background job (engine/jobs.go) and keeps its tab with the

//
// Who may cancel (the lead's decision for the owner to confirm, 2026-10-16): every origin, any
// job, a UI command (D-2: it runs without asking). A stop writes nothing to the cluster and undoes
// nothing; agents could already stop any job by closing its tab (dock.close, a UI command), so
// limiting job.cancel to the jobs an agent started would guard nothing. The tab's outcome says
// when an agent cancelled it ("Stopped: cancelled by an agent."), and an agent's job.cancel is in
// the audit log as every agent command is.
