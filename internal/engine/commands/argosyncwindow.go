// A sync Cogpit writes respects the AppProject's sync windows (A33, owner 2026-10-14 evening;
// H-67; the check in kinds.ArgoSyncBlocked): Sync is greyed with the reason while the cache holds
// the project and a window blocks, and the write is refused per Application once the project is
// read for it. A project Cogpit may not read, or that is not there, blocks nothing here: Argo CD's
// controller still honours its windows. A window that cannot be read blocks, with the reason.
