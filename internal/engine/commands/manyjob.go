// Actions on a selection, within the call or as a background job (G4, built 2026-10-16): Delete
// (object.deleteMany), Restart (workload.restartMany), the Flux actions but Reconcile with Source
// (flux.reconcileMany, suspendMany, resumeMany, resetMany; Reconcile with Source is always a job,
// fluxsourcejob.go) and Argo CD's Sync and Refresh (argocd.application.syncMany, refreshMany). Each
// asks for its confirmation as before, in Dispatch, before it runs; then it acts on the objects
// the user confirmed, one after the other, each bound to its confirmed UID.
//
// At most engine.DirectSelection objects (10) run within the call and return what was done and
// what was not, as before. More run as a job (engine.StartJob): the command returns at once with
// the job's dock tab, whose steps are the objects, so the window and agents (ui_state, the tab's
// job) follow each object's progress, and job.cancel or the tab's Cancel button stops what is left.
// A request under way when the job is stopped finishes, so that its step says what it did (D-58's
// request timeouts bound one that would not end); the steps after it are not attempted and say why.
// A failure is that object's: the others go on, and nothing is retried. The job's outcome counts
// what was done, what failed and what was not attempted; a toast says it when the job ends by
// itself.
//
// A crash ends the job like a stop, and what it wrote stays (D-11, jobs.go): each object's action
// is one request (Argo CD's Sync at most argoSyncAttempts of the same write), so no object is left
// half-done, only objects done and objects not attempted, which the lists show; each command's
// comment says why that is harmless for it.
