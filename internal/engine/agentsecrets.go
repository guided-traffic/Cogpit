// The Secrets an agent's read waits for (H-82; the owner's decision of 2026-10-14, option b). The
// filter in Dispatch replaces the values of the Secrets the cache holds in what an agent reads, and
// until then the cache held them only while the Secrets view was open and for its warm period
// after: a log an agent read in a session without that view went out as printed. Now a result the
// filter reads (forAgent) first takes the Secrets as the Secrets view would read them (the access
// reviews' plan: in all namespaces, or in each namespace the user may list them in), waits for them
// bounded by agentSecretsWait, and lets them go at once: the cache keeps them warm for its warm
// period (5 minutes by default) after the last agent read, and a read within it costs no request.
// Options were (a) only what the cache holds anyway, (b) this, (c) the Secrets watched whenever the
// MCP server is on; the owner chose (b). The window's reads and the CLI's start nothing.
