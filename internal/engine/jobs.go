// Background jobs (A91, the owner's decision of 2026-10-14 evening; G4). A command whose work
// outlives its call, as Reconcile with Source does while it waits for Flux's controllers, or an
// action on a selection of more than DirectSelection objects, starts a job: the command returns at
// once with the job's dock tab, and the job runs on a goroutine of the session's. The tab is engine
// state (DockTab.Job): the job's steps, each pending, running, done, failed or stopped with a line
// of detail, their counts, its state and its outcome, so that agents read its progress with
// ui_state as the window shows it in the dock.
//
// A job ends when its work ends, when it is cancelled (job.cancel, the tab's Cancel button: the tab
// stays with the outcome), when the user closes its tab (closing stops the job, it undoes nothing
// written so far), when the connected cluster changes or goes, or when the session closes. Jobs are
// not journaled: a crash ends one, and what it had written stays; each job's command says why that
// is harmless (D-11). A job's goroutine recovers from a panic at its boundary, which fails the job.
//
// A job keeps its command's context values (JobSpec.Parent): the origin, the confirmation the user
// gave with the UIDs it bound, so that each step acts on exactly the objects confirmed. A job an
// agent started gets a third audit line when it ends (phase "ended", AuditEntry), after the
// "requested" and "done" lines of the command that started it.
