// A background cluster's login, held (D-69 item 4; the owner, 2026-10-16: by default a background
// cluster's login is renewed as the shown cluster's is, configurable). The cluster setting "Renew
// the login while the cluster is not shown" (ClusterSettings.HoldBackgroundLogin, its negation, so
// that the default is a zero value) is on by default. Off, a connected cluster that the window does
// not show holds its credential plugin (cluster.Conn.HoldLogin): a login that expires by its time,
// or that the API server rejects, is not renewed, so no browser login pops up while the user works
// with another cluster. The cluster's watch then lapses (stateLapsed):
//
//   - the UI state shows the connection Connected with ConnectedCluster.LoginLapsed and the reason
//     lapsedReason: grey, not red (the owner: red says the user must act, and whether a renewal
//     would work is not known);
//   - the heartbeat pauses (a request would only fail), the gates hold the informers' lists and
//     watches and refuse every other request with cluster.ErrLoginLapsed, writes are disabled with
//     "login lapsed: show the cluster to renew it";
//   - a stream that is open goes on (the API server checked the login when it opened); one that has
//     to open again waits with a notice line (logsresume.go, workloadlogs.go), port forwards do not
//     dial, a drain or a Helm action stops as at an interruption (D-11);
//   - showing the cluster renews the login as D-58 renews the shown cluster's: the approved plugin
//     runs once (one whose program changed asks first, D-26), LoginExpired with Log in again when
//     that does not help within 30 s; Log in again (cluster.login with the context) renews it with
//     the plugin's browser for as long as the user takes; turning the setting on renews it in the
//     background. An agent's read or write never renews it: it gets the lapsed login's error, and
//     its reads from the cache a note (lapsedNote).

// lapse makes the login lapsed: the plugin was held when the login needed it. Coming from an
// interruption, its time stays.
