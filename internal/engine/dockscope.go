// The dock per cluster (D-69 item 9, stage 2, built 2026-10-16): the dock shows the tabs of the
// cluster the window shows and the tabs of no cluster (the Audit Log, the Diagnostics), so that a
// terminal never stands beside another cluster's log. The other clusters' tabs stay in
// UIState.Dock with their streams running, hidden, and come back with what ran meanwhile when their
// cluster is shown again (as Lens). A local terminal belongs to the cluster it was opened for
// (DockTab.Context).
//
// Each cluster keeps its own active tab and whether its dock was open: ActiveDock and DockOpen are
// the shown cluster's, and the engine keeps every other cluster's while it is not shown
// (UIState.dockMemo), so that agents read in ui_state what the window shows: dock lists every tab
// with its context (dock_read finds a hidden one by its id), activeDock and dockOpen are the shown
// cluster's. The dock's height is the window's (a split it keeps for every cluster), as the panels'
// widths are (panelwidths.go).
//
// The rules (syncDockScope, which SyncDock runs after every change):
//   - showing another cluster keeps the left one's active tab and open state, and gives the shown
//     one its own back: the tab it had active (else its last tab), open as it was; a cluster shown
//     the first time keeps a tab of no cluster that was active, else shows its last tab, collapsed;
//   - a tab of a cluster not shown made active (an agent's pod_logs or terminal_open on a cluster
//     the window does not show) becomes that cluster's active tab, its dock open for when it is
//     shown; the shown dock keeps its tab;
//   - the active tab closing gives way to its nearest neighbour the dock shows, never to a hidden
//     cluster's tab;
//   - a hidden cluster's active tab closing gives way to its last tab; a cluster without tabs keeps
//     nothing.
//
// dock.activate of a hidden cluster's tab shows that cluster first (commands/dock.go), as
// ui.navigate shows the cluster of an object it opens.

// was open.
