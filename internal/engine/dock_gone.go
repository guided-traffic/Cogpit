// The dock's tabs of a context that leaves Cogpit (G5, G13; FIXUP 2026-10-14). A removed
// kubeconfig source's contexts (closeTabsOfSource) and those whose file is gone
// (closeTabsOfGoneFiles) lose their cluster tabs (UIState.dropContexts); since 2026-10-14 they lose
// their dock tabs with them: logs, terminals, shells, a node shell, editors and Helm tabs, every
// tab bound to one of those contexts (a tab without a context, the Audit Log, stays). What a
// tab's close does follows, as for dock.close: the window ends its stream or shell, and a node
// shell's pod is deleted (endClosedNodeShells, D-37). One thing differs: closing a tab discards its
// unsaved text, but these tabs close without the user, so an editor's unsaved text is first kept
// as a draft (Drafts.keep), offered when its cluster connects again (D-11). Cogpit's default, not
// the owner's decision (Lens's behaviour is not captured): a terminal or a log stream of a cluster
// Cogpit no longer offers would act on a context that is gone, as a cluster tab would fail to
// connect.
