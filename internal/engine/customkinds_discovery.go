// Curated kinds from API discovery (A90, the owner's decision of 2026-10-14 evening): a user who may
// not list the custom resource definitions (a ClusterRole is needed for that, so as a rule a
// namespace-limited user) had no Flux or Argo CD kinds at all. Discovery, which every authenticated
// user may read (system:discovery), names the resources the cluster serves; a kind Cogpit has a
// curated profile for (kinds.Curated: Flux's thirteen, Argo CD's three, the Vertical Pod
// Autoscalers) that the cluster serves at a version the profile reads gets that profile, as its
// definition would give it, and Argo CD's settings views come with its Applications as they do
// with the definitions. Generic custom resources stay invisible: discovery names their resources
// but not their printer columns, and the owner kept them out. Flux's HelmCharts have no curated
// profile, so Reconcile with Source of a Helm release made from spec.chart says the cluster does
// not serve them, for such a user.
//
// Discovery is asked while the definitions cannot be listed, at each rebuild of the custom kinds:
// after the refused list that ends their watch (customKinds.drop), and again when a refresh of the
// access reviews takes the watch again (retake). The connection's discovery result is cached, in
// memory and in the disk cache (D-65), for cluster.ServedResourcesTTL, since no list of the
// definitions confirms it, and a refresh of the access reviews asks the server again (retake). A
// kind installed while the definitions stay refused shows after the next refresh, or at a connect
// once the cached answer is older than that.

// discoveryTimeout bounds one discovery of the curated kinds.
