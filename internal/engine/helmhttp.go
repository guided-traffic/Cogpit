// A Helm repository's user and password over plain http (credentials H-40, D-29; owner
// 2026-10-14): a repository of Helm's file whose URL is http:// and that has basic auth downloads
// nothing until the user allowed, once, that its credentials cross the network unencrypted. Then
// it is used as helm uses it, the background refresh included. The allowance is kept like a
// kubeconfig credential plugin's (kubeconfigs_approvals.go): in a file of Cogpit's own,
// owner-only, bound to the repository's name, its URL and its user name
// (helm.Repository.HTTPBinding); a changed URL or user name asks again, a changed password does
// not. Only the user's own action in Cogpit's window gives it (helm.repo.allowHTTPCredentials is
// GUI-only, D-2): an agent never allows the requests it would make, and it reads why a repository
// is not downloaded in helm.repo.list. A repository without credentials over http needs no
// allowance (only trust-boundaries H-41 applies to it). The helm package refuses such a download
// by itself (helm.ErrCredentialsOverHTTP); the engine hands it a copy the user allowed.
