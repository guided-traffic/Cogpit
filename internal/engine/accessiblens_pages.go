// The pages that read custom kinds (the Flux and Argo CD dashboards, D-34, D-36) for a
// namespace-limited user (G3; FIXUP 2026-10-14, architecture §5). Both were built before the
// namespace-limited fixes, with workers of their own: the open page took its kinds as a pending
// plan reads them, in all namespaces, and an agent's read with no page open did too, then waited
// 15 seconds for a list the API server refused. Now the open page waits for its kinds' plans as a
// view does (acquireForPage: nothing while the access reviews are out), its key tells a pending
// plan apart (pageReadKey), and an agent's read waits for the plans and follows a refusal
// (openFollowing), as the Overviews' do.

// acquireForPage is an open page's handle on one of its kinds: as the kind's plan says, and
// nothing while the plan is pending (cache.Pending), as the view holds nothing then, so that a
// user who may not list the kind in all namespaces is never sent a read there that the access
// reviews would have refused. The page starts again once they answer (pageReadKey).

// their definitions), or they are still being listed; "" when the custom kinds are known. Before
