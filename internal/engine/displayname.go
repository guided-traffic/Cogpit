// One short name for a cluster, everywhere (D-68, the owner, 2026-10-16: "überall gleich"). A
// kubeconfig context is often called "<user>@<cluster>" ("kubernetes-admin@prod-eu", the name
// kubeadm, kind's admin config and many cloud CLIs write), which leaves the part that tells
// clusters apart at the end of a long name the navigator cuts. The window names a context by
// ClusterName: the display name the user set in Cluster Settings › General, else ShortContextName
// of the context's name. The full name stays in every tooltip and in Cluster Settings; agents keep
// the full context ids in every command and in ui_state.

// ShortContextName is the name a context shows without a display name of the user's: the part of
// its kubeconfig name after the last "@" ("kubernetes-admin@prod-eu" → "prod-eu", "a@b@c" → "c",
// "@prod" → "prod"), else the whole name. A name with nothing but blanks after its last "@"
// ("admin@", "@") stays whole.
