// Selections (ui-parity › Tables, G5, G7, G9). UIState.Selected is the open view's selection, the
// checked rows, which ui.select sets for the user (the row checkboxes, the header's checkbox, ⌘- and
// ⇧-click) and for agents alike, so both see and drive the same selection. An action on a selection
// is a command whose parameters take the objects in a required "refs" array (ParamRefs) and that
// has an Order: object.deleteMany. Registry.SelectionActions lists them for a selection's menu, and
// Registry.Actions (the menus of one object) leaves them out.
//
// The owner's decision (A73, 2026-10-14 evening; built 2026-10-15): a plain click on a row opens
// its drawer and keeps the checked rows checked. The click is ui.select's mode open (SelectOpen):
// the drawer moves to the row's object and the selection stays as it is, the clicked row neither
// checked nor unchecked. Cogpit's defaults (inferred, not the owner's decision, 2026-10-13): a
// checkbox, ⌘-click and ⇧-click change the selection without opening the drawer; the header's
// checkbox selects the rows the view shows (the namespace filter and the search applied) or clears
// the selection; an action takes at most MaxSelection objects at once.

// ParamRefs is the parameter of a command that acts on a selection: the objects (model.ObjectRef).
const ParamRefs = "refs"

// MaxSelection is the most objects one action on a selection takes (Cogpit's bound, inferred;
// the owner confirmed it for Delete, A72): 500 deletes take about 100 seconds at the cluster
// connection's 5 requests per second. Since G4 (2026-10-16) a selection of more than
// DirectSelection objects runs as a background job whose dock tab shows its progress and can be
// cancelled; the bound stays, the confirmation listing every object (the lead's decision for the
// owner to confirm).
const MaxSelection = 500

// DirectSelection is the most objects an action on a selection acts on within its call, returning
// what it did as one object's action does; a larger selection runs as a background job (jobs.go)
// and the command returns at once with the job's tab (G4; the lead's decision for the owner to
// confirm, 2026-10-16). Ten is the cluster connection's burst of requests (cluster.DefaultBurst):
// up to ten go out at once and end within about a second on a healthy connection, a toast saying
// how they went; beyond it the connection's 5 requests per second spread them over seconds to
// minutes, which the job's tab shows step by step.
