// The built-in agent keeps its conversations across restarts in an owner-only file, scrubbed
// (D-10, the owner's decision of 2026-10-14 late evening, as D-19 keeps Secret values out of
// drafts): before a tool result, an answer or a message is kept, the values of the connected
// cluster's Secrets in it are replaced by «secret <ns>/<name>/<key>», as the H-82 filter replaces
// them in what agents read. A connection the user marked private reads like the user
// (Invocation.ReadsLikeUser), so its results carry values the filter did not see; this is the step
// that keeps them off the disk.

// ErrScrubContext refuses to scrub for a context that is not connected: the Secrets the filter
// knows are the connected clusters'.

// read does (agentSecrets: listed, or refused, within 10 s; the cache keeps them warm afterwards),
// so that a value is replaced even when no view held the Secrets. It fails closed: an error
// (ErrScrubContext when kubeContext is not connected, ErrAgentSecretsPending, ctx's error) and no
// text when the Secrets could not be read; the caller then keeps nothing of the texts. It never
// logs or returns a value it replaced.
