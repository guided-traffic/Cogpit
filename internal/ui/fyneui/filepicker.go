// Every file chooser of the window goes through the shell's filePicker (D-72, the owner's order
// of 2026-10-16 night): on macOS the system's own panels, NSOpenPanel and NSSavePanel as a sheet
// on Cogpit's window (internal/ui/nativedialog), so that Cogpit lists no folder of its own to
// draw a chooser and macOS grants what the user picks without a privacy prompt. Where there is no
// system panel (Windows and Linux until M11, Fyne's test driver, which has no NSWindow) open and
// save report false and each chooser shows its Fyne dialog as before: Cogpit's own "Sync Files
// and Folders" browser (syncpicker.go), since Fyne's dialogs choose a file or a folder, never
// both, and Fyne's file dialogs for the rest. Tests inject a recorder (filepicker_test.go).
//
// The choosers: Sync Files and Folders (kubeconfigs.go), a cluster's icon and a folder for a
// terminal's working directory or for kubectl's binaries (the settings pages), a chat
// connection's CA file (Preferences › Agent), and the three saves: a table's CSV, the Create tab's
// YAML and a log tab's lines (filepicker_choosers.go).
