// directory and the kubectl folder, a chat connection's CA file. One owner-only JSON file in
// Cogpit's configuration directory, written whole through engine.WritePrivateFile (0600 in a 0700
// directory, replaced atomically); no keychain (the owner's rule). At start the app resolves them
// and starts accessing their items before anything reads a source (cmd/cogpit), so that macOS
