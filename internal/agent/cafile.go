// A connection's CA file (engine.ChatConnection.CAFile, the owner's decision of 2026-10-15): the
// CA certificates of an https server with a private CA. For that connection they replace the
// system's roots, as a kubeconfig's certificate-authority does for kubectl: only the file's CAs
// vouch for the endpoint, a public CA cannot (N141, the owner's decision in the audit of
// 2026-10-16; until then the file was added to the system's roots). A server that moves to a public
// certificate fails until the field is cleared, with an error that says the connection trusts only
// its CA file (transportError).
//
// How the roots are built, checked in Go 1.27.2's crypto/x509 (cert_pool.go, verify.go
// Certificate.Verify): a pool from x509.NewCertPool is not the system's, so Verify never hands it
// to the platform verifier (macOS's Security framework, its trust store and the user's trust
// settings) and checks the chain with Go's own verifier against the file's certificates alone.
// x509.SystemCertPool with the file appended would keep the system's mark, and Verify would ask
// the platform verifier first and Go only when that failed: every public CA trusted beside the
// file, which is what the owner chose against. Since Go 1.27, SSL_CERT_FILE or SSL_CERT_DIR in the
// environment change the system's roots only, so they do not reach a connection with a CA file.
//
// The file is read whenever a request is sent (a turn, a connection test, the models list), so a
// changed file counts from the next; the client is kept per connection and file content, so the
// connections it opened are reused. The file may hold anything else besides certificates (only
// CERTIFICATE blocks are taken); its content is never logged or quoted in an error.
