# dmgbuild's settings for the template of Cogpit's disk image (hack/macos/dmg-template.sh, D-70):
# the window the owner chose in the DMG lab, read from packaging/dmg/lab.json (its "settings", in
# points, as the lab draws them): the window's size, the icons' size and centres, the label size.
# The background (packaging/dmg/background.png and @2x, joined into one TIFF) is the lab's drawing
# of the same settings, without the icons and labels, which Finder draws. The template holds no
# app: the signing job copies the signed Cogpit.app in with Apple's tools only (release.sh).
