# The macOS download of a release (docs/developer/releasing.md#the-release-pipeline), made from
# what `make dist-app` built: the app, with cogpit-cli inside it (D-16), in a disk image, signed
# with the Developer ID and notarized by Apple when the signing secrets are there. The release
# pipeline's job "Sign and notarize (macOS)" runs it through `make dist-macos`; on a Mac it runs
# the same, signed ad-hoc.
#
#   hack/macos/release.sh <version> <in dir> <out dir>        everything (make dist-macos)
#   hack/macos/release.sh sign <version> <in dir> <out dir>   the pipeline's first job
#   hack/macos/release.sh notarize <version> <dir>            the pipeline's second job
#   hack/macos/release.sh cleanup
#
# <in dir> holds Cogpit_<version>_darwin_<arch>.zip; <out dir> receives the download. The pipeline
# splits the course in two jobs: `sign` signs the app and the disk image, submits the disk image to
# Apple's notary service without waiting and records the submission in
# <out dir>/notary-submission.json (its id, the disk image's name and SHA-256); `notarize` waits
# for Apple's verdict on exactly that submission, staples the ticket, checks the result and removes
# the record. A re-run of a `notarize` that ran out of time waits for the same submission: signing
# and submitting again makes a new disk image that starts Apple's queue over (v0.9.0 to v0.12.0,
# 2026-10-15: every re-run a new submission, none finished within the 45 minutes the one job
# waited). What happens depends on the environment:
#
#   Developer ID  MACOS_SIGN_P12 (the .p12, base64), MACOS_SIGN_P12_PASSWORD, APPLE_API_KEY_P8 (the
#                 App Store Connect key, base64), APPLE_API_KEY_ID and APPLE_API_ISSUER_ID all set,
#                 with APPLE_TEAM_ID and Apple's intermediate pinned in MACOS_SIGN_CA_URL and
#                 MACOS_SIGN_CA_SHA256: a temporary keychain; the app and its nested code (Sparkle,
#                 cogpit-cli) signed inside-out with the hardened runtime and a secure timestamp;
#                 Cogpit-<version>-macos-<arch>.dmg built and signed, notarized and its ticket
#                 stapled; every signature checked, and the disk image and the app in it as
#                 Gatekeeper checks them.
#   ad-hoc        MACOS_SIGN=adhoc and none of the secrets (a Mac without the material): the same
#                 steps signed ad-hoc, without notarization and Gatekeeper's check.
#   unsigned      none of the secrets: the app zip passes through unchanged.
#
# Some of the secrets but not all is an error, never a quiet fallback to an unsigned download; so is
# every failed signature, notarization or check. `cleanup` deletes the temporary keychain and the
# key files; the pipeline runs it with if: always() after a cancelled run. Secrets never reach the
# log: no set -x, nothing derived from them is echoed, the keychain's password is masked.
#
# Entitlements: none, for the app, Sparkle's parts and cogpit-cli. Go generates no code at run time
# (no JIT, no unsigned executable memory), the app loads only Apple's frameworks and
# Sparkle.framework, which carries the app's own signature (library validation holds), cogpit-cli
# (pure Go) loads only the system's libraries, and neither uses the camera, microphone, location,
# contacts or Apple Events. `make dist-macos MACOS_SIGN=adhoc` and starting the app
# signed this way is the check (docs/developer/releasing.md#signing-and-notarization).
